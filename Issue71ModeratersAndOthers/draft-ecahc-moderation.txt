                       IETF Community Moderation
                     draft-ecahc-moderation-latest

Abstract

   This document describes the creation of a moderator team for all of
   the IETF's various contribution channels.  Without removing existing
   responsibilities for working group management, this team enables a
   uniform approach to moderation of disruptive participation across all
   mailing lists and other methods of IETF collaboration.

1.  Introduction

   This document proposes the creation of a moderator team for all of
   the IETF's various contribution channels.  This moderator team is
   modeled after, and subsumes, the moderator team for the IETF
   discussion list [RFC9245].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in their normal English sense; they
   are shown in uppercase for emphasis and clarity.

      |  TODO: Get feedback from the community whether this redefinition
      |  of BCP14 terms in process documents is something they support.

3.  Motivation

   The IETF community has defined general guidelines of conduct for
   personal interaction in the IETF [RFC7154], and the IESG has defined
   an anti-harassment policy for the IETF [AHP] for which the IETF
   community has defined anti-harassment procedures [RFC7776],
   empowering an ombudsteam [OT] to take necessary action.

   Dealing with _disruptive_ behavior, however, is not part of the role
   of the ombudsteam.  [RFC3934] tasks the chairs of each IETF working
   group with moderating their group's in-person meetings and mailing
   lists, and an IESG statement [MODML] describes additional guidance to
   working group chairs about how - but not when - to moderate their
   lists.

   For IETF mailing lists not associated with a working group, another
   IESG statement [DP] clarifies that the list administrators are tasked
   with moderation.  And the IETF list for general discussions has,
   mostly for historic reasons, a team of moderators that are not list
   administrators and operate by a different set of processes [RFC9245].

   Note that the term "moderation" can refer both to _preemptive_
   moderation, where moderators review attempted participation before it
   occurs (such as reviewing messages to a mailing list), and _reactive_
   moderation, where moderators intervene after problematic
   participation has occurred.  The IETF historically mainly practiced
   reactive moderation, with a spectrum from gentle reminders on- and
   off-list, all the way to suspension of posting rights and other ways
   of participating or communicating.  It is up to the moderator team to
   decide which mix of preemptive and reactive moderation to employ as
   part of their processes.

   In addition, [RFC3683] defines a process for revoking an individual's
   posting rights to IETF mailing lists following a community last-call
   of a "posting rights" action (PR-action) proposed by the IESG, often
   in response to complaints from the community.

   This fractured approach to moderation of disruptive participation
   through chairs, list administrators, and moderator teams, combined
   with the IESG-led process of PR-actions, has proven to be less than
   ideal:

   *  The IETF community has not been able to agree on a common
      definition of disruptive behavior.  Therefore, chairs and list
      administrators apply individually different criteria when making
      decisions, and participants have different expectations for when
      PR-actions are warranted.

   *  The moderation process that chairs and list administrators need to
      follow [RFC3934] is slow and cumbersome, which makes it ill-suited
      to situations that escalate quickly.  It also assumes that the
      originator of disruptive behavior is a misguided participant who
      can be reasoned with and who will change their ways.

   *  Chairs and list administrators may only enact moderation actions
      for their single list, which is ill-suited when a pattern of
      disruptive behavior spans multiple lists.  Also, chairs and list
      administrators may not be fully aware of disruptive behavior that
      spans multiple lists, due to not being subscribed to some of the
      affected.

   *  PR-actions, which can address disruptive behavior across several
      lists, are cumbersome and slow, and the community has not been
      able to agree on a common definition of disruptive behavior.  This
      has led to a situation where PR-actions are rarely used, and when
      they are used, they are perceived as very heavy-handed.

   *  For a given mailing list, participants may not feel comfortable
      reporting disruptive behavior to a chair or list administrator,
      for various reasons.  For mailing lists not associated with
      working groups, list administrators are not even publicly
      identified - they can only be contacted through an anonymous alias
      address.  This exacerbates the problem, because participants may
      not be comfortable reporting disruptive behavior to an anonymous
      party.

   *  The IETF offers participation not only through in-person meetings
      and mailing lists, which are the two channels of participation for
      which moderation processes are currently defined.  IETF business
      also happens in chat channels, remote meeting participation
      systems, virtual meetings, wikis, GitHub repositories, and more.
      How disruptive behavior is moderated in these channels is
      currently undefined.

4.  IETF Moderator Team

   This document proposes a different, uniform approach to moderating
   the IETF's various participation channels: a moderator team for the
   IETF.  The creation of this team intends to address the issues
   identified in Section 3.

4.1.  Composition

   The moderator team will initially consist of no less than five
   individuals.  The IETF Chair appoints and replaces members of the
   moderator team.  In selecting members, the IETF Chair will take into
   account geographic coverage, expected and unexpected absenses, and
   diverse points of view.  The moderation team may expand or contract
   based on operational experience.  Apart from appointing and replacing
   moderators, the IETF Chair SHALL refrain from the day-to-day
   operation and management of the moderator team.  The moderator team
   MAY decide to consult with the IETF Chair when needed.

   Because the IESG and IAB are in the appeals chain for moderator team
   decisions (see Section 4.5), the IETF Chair MUST NOT appoint a
   moderator who is serving on the IESG or IAB.  Individuals serving on
   other bodies to which the NomCom appoints members, such as the IETF
   Trust or the LLC Board, as well as LLC staff and contractors SHALL
   also be excluded from serving on the moderator team.  If a moderator
   is assuming any such role, they SHALL step down from the moderator
   team soon after.

4.2.  Scope

   The IETF moderator team SHALL moderate all the IETF's various current
   and future participation channels.  At present, these include mailing
   lists, chat channels, and discussions in other systems that the IETF
   or WGs have chosen to employ, such as GitHub repositories, Wikis, or
   issue trackers.

   It is not expected that the moderator team will be monitoring every
   IETF channel, but rather that participants MAY and chairs SHOULD flag
   concerns about disruptive behavior to the moderator team.  However,
   the moderator team SHOULD actively monitor a small set of key
   participation channels, including, for example, the IETF discussion
   and last-call mailing lists or the IETF plenary chat channel.  The
   moderator team should decide which channels are in this set based on
   their own judgment and community suggestions.  (Note that some
   participation channels, such as the examples given in the previous
   sentence, have no chairs or other community leadership, so the
   moderation team MUST handle those.)

4.2.1.  Non-IETF communication channels and private communications
        excluded

   It is important to note that the moderation team only moderates
   _public_ IETF participation channels.  Their mandate does not extend
   to problematic behavior in private channels, such as private chat
   channels, direct messages, or conversations or other interactions
   outside of meetings.  In such cases, the Ombudsteam should be
   approached.

4.2.2.  IETF Working Groups

   The management and moderation of participation channels associated
   with various IETF groups, including their mailing lists, chat
   channels and in-person, remote, or interim meetings remains primarily
   a task of the relevant group's management, such as WG chairs.
   However, moderators are available for consultation and assistance
   should issues arise, and they MAY proactively confer with the group
   management over potential patterns of behavior.  Group participants
   MAY and chairs SHOULD alert the moderators to problematic behavior.
   When moderators observe or are alerted to problematic behavior on
   such channels, they SHOULD consult with the group's management to
   jointly determine an appropriate moderation response.  The moderation
   team MAY take actions against someone in a working group forum, but
   they MUST inform management of relevant groups, including WG chairs
   and area directors, when they do so.  Working group chairs MAY
   suspend such actions in their respective groups, if they believe the
   interests of the working group are hindered by such actions.  Neither
   set of decisions should be taken lightly: the moderation team should
   respect the views of the group management in such cases, and the
   group management should respect the moderation team's task of
   upholding an overall IETF-wide uniformity for moderation.

   The moderator team MAY initiate moderation actions by itself;
   individual participants SHOULD also alert the team to disruptive
   behavior they observe.  Participants should be able to contact the
   moderator team in ways that are, ideally, integrated into the various
   participation channels the IETF offers.  The moderator team SHALL
   keep the identities of participants requesting moderation
   confidential.

4.3.  Transparency

   The moderator team SHALL operate according to a consistent set of
   criteria, processes, and actions.  The moderator team SHALL
   independently define and execute their role.  They SHALL maintain a
   public set of moderation criteria, processes, actions, and other
   material that allows the community to understand and comment on the
   role of the team.  The moderator team SHOULD consider adopting
   moderation criteria, processes, and actions that other technical
   communities have found suitable.  The moderator team's criteria and
   processes SHALL be developed with community input, but they are not
   expected to be documented in the RFC series.

   Some of these processes may rely on automated mechanisms, such as
   rate-limiting emails to lists or messages to chat channels.  (The
   IETF's deliberately low bar to participation makes it easy to create
   throw-away personas for such denial-of-service behavior.)

      |  TODO: This gives the moderator team broad freedom to define
      |  processes and actions.  Should this document define some
      |  boundaries for what the moderator team can do?

   The moderator team SHOULD create and maintain a public mailing list
   for the community to discuss both the general moderation criteria and
   individual moderation decisions.  To not distract from the topic-
   oriented discussion on other IETF lists, such meta-discussions SHOULD
   be actively redirected to the moderation discussion list.

4.4.  Training

   The IETF is committed to providing and/or funding training for
   appointed moderators as necessary.  The IETF Chair will negotiate any
   required funding or resources with IETF Administration LLC [RFC8711].

4.5.  Appeals

   Because the moderator team serves at the discretion of the IETF
   Chair, any moderation decision can be appealed to the IETF Chair by
   anyone, per [RFC2026].  Disagreements with a decision by the IETF
   Chair can brought to their attention.  If this does not lead to a
   resolution, a decision by the IETF Chair can be appealed as described
   in [RFC2026], as with any other Area Director decision.  In this
   case, the appeals chain starts with an appeal to the entire IESG.

4.6.  Team Diversity

   Due to the global nature of the IETF, the membership of this team
   SHOULD reflect a diversity of time zones and other participant
   characteristics that lets it operate effectively around the clock and
   throughout the year.  Ideally, the moderator team should be able to
   respond to issues within a few hours.

   Team diversity is also important to ensure any participant observing
   problematic behavior can identify a moderator they feel comfortable
   contacting.

4.7.  Relation to the Ombudsteam

   The moderator team SHALL complement the efforts of the IETF
   ombudsteam [OT], whose focus on anti-harassment and operation SHALL
   remain unchanged.  The moderator team and ombudsteam are expected to
   work together in cases that may involve both disruptive behavior and
   harassment; they may determine the most effective way to do so in
   each case.  For example, the ombudsteam MAY decide to have one of
   their members serve as a liaison to the moderator team.

   The ombudsteam has strict rules of confidentiality.  If a moderation
   case overlaps with an ombudsteam case, confidential information MUST
   NOT be shared between the teams.

4.8.  Relation to the IETF LLC

   The Board of Directors of the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC) has
   fiduciary duty for the overall organization, which includes the duty
   to protect the organization from legal risk that may arise from
   illegal, vulgar, or manifestly harassing behavior of IETF
   participants.

   This protection MAY include the need for the LLC to take emergency
   moderation actions.  These emergency actions are expected to be
   extremely rare, of temporary nature, and the indicdents that required
   them SHOULD be immediately raised with the moderator team to let them
   determine any follow-up or more permanent moderation action.  These
   incidents and the taken emergency action SHOULD also be communitated
   to the IETF community.

5.  Changes to Existing RFCs

   Creation of the IETF moderator team requires some changes to existing
   RFCs and also requires the IESG to update a number of their
   statements.  This section describes these changes.

      |  TODO: Add once we know this I-D will go forward in some form.

6.  Security Considerations

   The usual security considerations [RFC3552] do not apply to this
   document.

   Potential abuse of the moderation process for the suppression of
   undesired opinions is counteracted by the availability of an appeals
   process, per Section 4.5.

   The actions of the moderation team are intended to limit the
   likelihood of disruptive behavior by a few IETF participants from
   discouraging participation by other IETF participants.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
