Intro seems to imply it is the different types of channels. When we started the email thread I thought this was about all non-WG lists and different tooling (chat etc). Scope section seems to say that it is all lists and meetings and chat. But the ombudsteam part is still clearly not in it.\r\n\r\nI think there's some room for discussion here perhaps on what we are actually proposing. Are WGs in it or not? And WG meetings? I'm fine whatever the answer is but we should be clear about it. (I do think though that tracking all WG lists may be a large task for a single moderation team.)\r\n\r\nI think the introduction should clearly lay out what the unification is, e.g., \r\n\r\nOLD:\r\nThis document proposes the creation of a moderator team for all of the IETF's various contribution channels.\r\nNEW:\r\nThis document proposes the creation of a moderator team for all of the IETF's various contribution channels.

In the past, there have been very strong disagreements about moderation, and questioning of legitimacy of particular actions within the IETF process. Allowing the moderators to 'define [...] their role' and 'adopt moderation criteria' outside of the IETF consensus process opens up a number of questions about how that works, whether the output is legitimate in the eyes of the community, etc. \r\n\r\n> Maybe I'm missing it, but it's not clear to me what the *powers*\r\n> of moderators are.

It'd also be helpful if this draft listed the RFCs the authors believe will be updated or obsoleted if it is published.\r\n\r\n> S 4.4.\r\n>    Due to the global nature of the IETF, the membership of this team\r\n>    SHOULD reflect a diversity of time zones and other participant\r\n>    characteristics that lets it operate effectively around the clock and\r\n>    throughout the year.

I'm not sure that's necessary but if you think it is, then\r\n> you should say so.\r\n\r\nIf WG chairs lose the ability to moderate (which I know is an open question), handling an issue through a moderator team is going to inevitably add latency. So I think it is necessary -- IME it's much more effective if bad behaviour is caught and stopped early.\r\n\r\nTo that question of whether WG chairs should still be able to moderate -- I'm not sure, but I observe very different behaviour in different WGs. What passes in some WGs as normal debate would be flagged by chairs as disruptive. Will moderators appreciate these differences, or set a new level for some WGs? And what will that level be?\r\n\r\nWhether or not WG chairs still have the ability to moderate, it'd be good to understand what the expected interactions between chairs and moderators would be. E.g., will moderators check in with chairs on a proposed resolution, to get context and assure that it will work in that community? If chairs retain the ability to moderate, do they need to inform moderators when they act? Etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, an editorial nit: I found Section very difficult to read, in part due to the liberal sprinkling of references throughout the text. It might help to move references to the end of the applicable sentence, where possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n```",

I raised this point to Eliot a few days ago, and he agreed that it might be too much of an idiom. \r\n\r\nI also said I didn't like \"comity\". It is exactly the right word, but I thought it was a bit obscure and difficult to translate. That one I can live with, but I still think we should go for more plainspoken English in this document, since we need everyone to understand it. Should we say \"fora\", or just grit our teeth and write \"forums\"? Should the reader need to understand Latin pluralization in the midst of English? That kind of thing. Maybe just opt out and say \"venues\".",

              "body": "Overall I agree with the general mindset and decision-making here. However, when it gets down to implementation, I think the details leave an unspecified window that is open to interpretation.\r\n\r\nLet's take a hypothetical scenario:\r\n* Alice is a long-time contributor of the FOO WG\r\n* Alice sends an email to the FOO WG mailing list that the moderators find to be inappropriate\r\n* A moderator replies that this was inappropriate and asks Alice to do better\r\n* Alice digs their heels in, and repeats the offensive behavior\r\n* [time T0] The moderator reaches out privately to the chairs saying that they want to block Alice's email to the FOO WG list for 2 weeks\r\n* The FOO WG chair says that the moderator is overreacting and shouldn't take such a drastic measure because Alice is an important contributor and the topic at hand is a WGLC that will expire before those 2 weeks\r\n* The moderator and FOO WG chair talk but are unable to come to agreement\r\n* This gets escalated to the responsible AD for FOO, who decides to side with the moderator\r\n* [time T1] the moderator goes into the admin interface and puts Alice in moderation\r\n\r\nIn this example, the time delay between T0 and T1 could be multiple days. That's too much time as it could allow the list discussion to spiral out of control. So \"something\" needs to happen between T0 and T1, even if \"something\" is \"let Alice keep posting\" - in this context, inaction is still an action. So my question is: can we clarify what happens between T0 and T1 in this scenario? Options include:\r\n* Alice's posting rights are maintained\r\n* Alice's emails are moderated by the moderator\r\n* Alice's emails are moderated by the WG chair\r\n* Alice's emails are blocked\r\n* Both the moderator and chair have access to the admin interface so they play admin tennis constantly undoing the other's action to get the list in the state they want it to be in\r\n* We take the entire Internet offline and all go touch grass\r\n\r\nAnother way to phrase this whole thing could be to say that the moderator is allowed to put the block in place, but must immediately notify the chairs. If the chairs disagree, they can follow the usual appeals process, but aren't allowed to undo the moderator's action themselves until either they come to an agreement with the moderator, or the appeal is adjudicated.\r\n\r\n",

You don't need context there. :)\r\n\r\nI always try to suggest text, since one thing people often say is \"why not open a PR?\" when someone is just arguing. But that doesn't mean I am being insistent.\r\n\r\nEdit: I might also add that the README says \"Contributions can be made by creating pull requests.\" (subject to the usual Note Well material). Here, you have a well-written opener. I think anyone would perk up at that opening sentence vs \"This document describes the creation of a moderation team...\". I think you are missing that the first task is to get people to read the document in the first place.  Now, do you want to let Rob write that? Different question, but I'm OK with it if you write a better first sentence . \r\n\r\nThe trick here is this: you write one sentence about good things like empathy, honesty, and kindness. Then you flip to the \"This document describes...\" stuff with no verbal transition. It makes the procedural text much more powerful. If you look at my PR here, just imagine a \"\ud83d\udc40\" in the break after the first sentence. I don't care if you use my exact words.",

With this in mind, moderators are expected to identify when someone\r\nhas crossed a line, and what action is appropriate.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis probably addresses another point that @becarpenter made elsewhere as well.",

Engaged, respectful\u00a0discussion within the scope of a forum is not considered abuse, nor should someone be considered abusive solely because they are outside the rough consensus. Disagreement and diverse points of view within any standards organization are to be expected and are even healthy. \u00a0With that in mind, moderators are expected to identify when someone has crossed a line, and what action is appropriate. When someone crosses the line into disruptive behavior, some action must be taken to maintain the decorum of the community.\r\n\r\nModeration will be consistent and fair to encourage participation. Disagreements may be appealed, and decisions can be\r\nreconsidered over time.\r\n\r\nThe goal is explicitly **not** punishment, but maintaining an open, welcoming, non-hostile environment where all may participate on equal footing, regardless of their position or their past contributions.\"",
