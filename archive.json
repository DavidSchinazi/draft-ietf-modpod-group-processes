Intro seems to imply it is the different types of channels. When we started the email thread I thought this was about all non-WG lists and different tooling (chat etc). Scope section seems to say that it is all lists and meetings and chat. But the ombudsteam part is still clearly not in it.\r\n\r\nI think there's some room for discussion here perhaps on what we are actually proposing. Are WGs in it or not? And WG meetings? I'm fine whatever the answer is but we should be clear about it. (I do think though that tracking all WG lists may be a large task for a single moderation team.)\r\n\r\nI think the introduction should clearly lay out what the unification is, e.g., \r\n\r\nOLD:\r\nThis document proposes the creation of a moderator team for all of the IETF's various contribution channels.\r\nNEW:\r\nThis document proposes the creation of a moderator team for all of the IETF's various contribution channels.

In the past, there have been very strong disagreements about moderation, and questioning of legitimacy of particular actions within the IETF process. Allowing the moderators to 'define [...] their role' and 'adopt moderation criteria' outside of the IETF consensus process opens up a number of questions about how that works, whether the output is legitimate in the eyes of the community, etc. \r\n\r\n> Maybe I'm missing it, but it's not clear to me what the *powers*\r\n> of moderators are.

It'd also be helpful if this draft listed the RFCs the authors believe will be updated or obsoleted if it is published.\r\n\r\n> S 4.4.\r\n>    Due to the global nature of the IETF, the membership of this team\r\n>    SHOULD reflect a diversity of time zones and other participant\r\n>    characteristics that lets it operate effectively around the clock and\r\n>    throughout the year.

I'm not sure that's necessary but if you think it is, then\r\n> you should say so.\r\n\r\nIf WG chairs lose the ability to moderate (which I know is an open question), handling an issue through a moderator team is going to inevitably add latency. So I think it is necessary -- IME it's much more effective if bad behaviour is caught and stopped early.\r\n\r\nTo that question of whether WG chairs should still be able to moderate -- I'm not sure, but I observe very different behaviour in different WGs. What passes in some WGs as normal debate would be flagged by chairs as disruptive. Will moderators appreciate these differences, or set a new level for some WGs? And what will that level be?\r\n\r\nWhether or not WG chairs still have the ability to moderate, it'd be good to understand what the expected interactions between chairs and moderators would be. E.g., will moderators check in with chairs on a proposed resolution, to get context and assure that it will work in that community? If chairs retain the ability to moderate, do they need to inform moderators when they act? Etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, an editorial nit: I found Section very difficult to read, in part due to the liberal sprinkling of references throughout the text. It might help to move references to the end of the applicable sentence, where possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n```",
