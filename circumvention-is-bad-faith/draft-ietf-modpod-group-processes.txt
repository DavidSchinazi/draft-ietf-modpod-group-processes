                draft-ietf-modpod-group-processes-latest

Abstract

   The IETF will treat people with kindness and grace, but not endless
   patience.

   This document describes the creation of a moderator team for all the
   IETF's various contribution channels.  Without removing existing
   responsibilities for working group management, this team enables a
   uniform approach to moderation of disruptive participation across all
   mailing lists and other methods of IETF collaboration.

1.  Introduction

   This document proposes the creation of a moderator team for all the
   IETF's various contribution channels.  The moderator team is modeled
   after, and subsumes, the moderator team for the IETF discussion list
   [RFC9245] and is tasked to moderate *all* IETF participation
   channels.

   As a consequence, this document obsoletes [RFC3683] and the "posting
   rights" (PR) action it defines.  It also obsoletes Section 4 of
   [RFC9245], which defines the IETF discussion list moderation team.
   Finally, it updates Section 6.1 of [RFC2418], because the moderator
   team will now work together with working group chairs to moderate
   disruptive behavior.

1.1.  Background

   The IETF community has defined general guidelines for personal
   interactions in the IETF [RFC7154], and the IESG has defined an anti-
   harassment policy for the IETF [AHP] for which the IETF community has
   defined anti-harassment procedures [RFC7776], empowering an
   ombudsteam [OT] to take necessary action.

   Dealing with _disruptive_ behavior, however, is not part of the role
   of the ombudsteam.  [RFC3934] tasks the chairs of each IETF working
   group with moderating their group's in-person meetings and mailing
   lists, and an IESG statement [MODML] describes additional guidance to
   working group chairs about how — but not when — to moderate their
   lists.

   For IETF mailing lists not associated with a working group, another
   IESG statement [DP] clarifies that the list administrators are tasked
   with moderation.  And the IETF list for general discussions has,
   mostly for historic reasons, a team of moderators that are not list
   administrators and operate by a different set of processes [RFC9245].

   Note that the term "moderation" can refer both to _preemptive_
   moderation, where moderators review attempted participation before it
   occurs (such as reviewing messages to a mailing list), and _reactive_
   moderation, where moderators intervene after problematic
   participation has occurred.  The IETF historically mainly practiced
   reactive moderation, with a spectrum from gentle reminders on- and
   off-list, all the way to suspension of posting rights and other ways
   of participating or communicating.  It is up to the moderators to
   decide which mix of preemptive and reactive moderation to employ as
   part of their processes.

   In addition, [RFC3683] defines a process for revoking an individual's
   posting rights to IETF mailing lists following a community last-call
   of a "posting rights" action (PR-action) proposed by the IESG, often
   in response to complaints from the community.

   Experience and community input suggests that an evolution of the
   existing processes is necessary (see Appendix B).

1.2.  General Philosophy

   The cornerstone of our philosophy is first and foremost the
   individual, whose responsibility is to further the goals of the
   organization [RFC3935] in a manner consistent with the policy laid
   out in [RFC7154].

   The IETF is an open standards organization.  Engaged, respectful
   discussion that is within the scope of a forum should not be
   considered abuse, nor should someone be considered abusive solely
   because they are outside the rough consensus.  Disagreement and
   diverse points of view within any standards organization are to be
   expected, and are even healthy.  However, when someone crosses the
   line into disruptive behavior, some action must be taken in order to
   maintain decorum of the community.

   The moderation policy goals are as follows:

   *  Apply consistent, fair, and timely moderation of communication
      across all IETF channels without regard to one's position or
      previous contributions;

   *  Disagreements about moderation actions are addressed through
      appeals;

   *  Balance transparency against both privacy of individuals involved
      and further disruption to the community;

   *  Allow moderators to reconsider decisions; and

   *  Provide the broadest possible latitude to moderators, so that they
      may have the flexibility to address a broad range of individuals
      and circumstances.

   Questions about processes detailed below should be answered through
   the lens of these aims.

   The goal is explicitly *not* punishment, but to maintain an open,
   welcoming, non-hostile environment in which all may participate on an
   equal footing, regardless of their position or past contributions.

1.3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in their normal English sense; they
   are shown in uppercase for emphasis and clarity.

      |  TODO: Get feedback from the community whether this redefinition
      |  of BCP14 terms in process documents is something they support.

2.  IETF Moderator Team

   This document proposes a different, uniform approach to moderating
   the IETF's various participation channels: a moderator team for the
   IETF.  The creation of this team intends to address the issues
   identified in the previous model Appendix B and the principles
   described in the introduction.

2.1.  Composition

   The moderator team consists of no less than five individuals.  The
   IESG appoints and replaces moderators.  In selecting members, the
   IESG will take into account geographic coverage, expected and
   unexpected absences, and team diversity.  The moderator team may
   expand or contract based on operational experience.  Apart from
   appointing and replacing moderators, the IESG SHALL refrain from the
   day-to-day operation and management of the moderator team.  The
   moderators MAY decide to consult with the IESG when needed.

   Because the IESG and IAB are in the appeals chain for moderator team
   decisions (see Section 4.1), the IESG MUST NOT appoint a moderator
   who is serving on the IESG or IAB.  Individuals serving on other
   bodies to which the NomCom appoints members, such as the IETF Trust
   or the LLC Board, as well as LLC staff and contractors SHALL also be
   excluded from serving on the moderator team.  If a moderator is
   assuming any such role, they SHALL step down from the moderator team
   soon after.

2.1.1.  Team Diversity

   Due to the global nature of the IETF, the membership of this team
   SHOULD reflect a diversity of time zones and other participant
   characteristics that lets it operate effectively around the clock and
   throughout the year.  Ideally, the moderators should be able to
   respond to issues within a few hours.

   Team diversity is also important to ensure any participant observing
   problematic behavior can identify a moderator they feel comfortable
   contacting.

2.2.  Training

   The IETF is committed to providing and/or funding training for
   appointed moderators as necessary.  The IESG will negotiate any
   required funding or resources with IETF Administration LLC [RFC8711].

3.  Scope

   The IETF moderator team is responsible for establishing processes to
   address moderation needs across all IETF fora, both present and
   future, including, but not limited to, mailing lists, chat channels,
   and discussions in other systems that the IETF or WGs have chosen to
   employ, such as GitHub repositories, Wikis, or issue trackers.

   The moderators are authorized to moderate all non-working group fora,
   including the IETF discussion and last-call mailing lists and all
   non-WG mailing lists, as well as area mailing lists.  This also
   includes non-WG IETF-sponsored chat mechanisms.  (Involvement in the
   moderation of WGs is further discussed in Section 3.2.)

   It is not expected that the moderators will be monitoring every IETF
   channel, but rather that participants MAY and group management SHOULD
   flag concerns about disruptive behavior to the moderators.  However,
   the moderators SHOULD actively monitor a small set of key
   participation channels, including, for example, the IETF discussion
   and last-call mailing lists or the IETF plenary chat channel.  The
   moderators should decide which channels are in this set based on
   their own judgment and community suggestions.  (Note that some
   participation channels, such as the examples given in the previous
   sentence, have no chairs or other community leadership, so the
   moderators MUST handle those.)

   Moderators are expected to be a resource that the community can use
   to address problematic contributions.

3.1.  Non-IETF Communication Channels And Private Communications
      Excluded

   It is important to note that the moderator team only moderates
   _public_ IETF participation channels.  Their mandate does not extend
   to problematic behavior in private channels, such as private chat
   channels, direct messages, or conversations or other interactions
   outside of meetings.  In such cases, the Ombudsteam should be
   approached.

3.2.  IETF Working Groups

   The management and moderation of participation channels associated
   with various IETF working groups, including their mailing lists, chat
   channels and in-person, remote, or interim meetings remains primarily
   a task of the relevant group's management, such as WG chairs.  Group
   participants MAY and chairs MUST alert the moderators to problematic
   behavior that rises to the level that some action is needed.

   In the interest of timely and consistent moderation, moderators MAY
   take actions against someone in a working group setting, but they
   MUST immediately inform management of relevant groups, including WG
   chairs and area directors, when they do so.

   If working group management and moderators disagree about a group
   moderation action taken by one party unilaterally, the matter SHALL
   be taken up with the responsible area director(s) for resolution,
   and, when more than one area is involved, with the IESG.  Based on
   the result of this consultation, the moderation action may be upheld,
   modified or reverted.

   It is anticipated that such disagreements will be exceedingly rare.
   The moderators should respect the views of the group management in
   such cases, and the group management should respect the moderators'
   task of upholding an overall IETF-wide uniformity for moderation.

4.  Operations and Procedures of the Moderator Team and Transparency

   Within the bounds of the policies set within this memo and with the
   approval of the IESG, the moderator team SHALL define any additional
   processes and moderation criteria necessary to execute their role.
   Those processes and criteria SHALL be developed with community input
   and made public, but need not be documented in the RFC series.

   The intent of this memo is to provide the widest possible freedom of
   action to the moderators, with a few constraints.  Examples of
   actions that could be taken include:

   *  Automated rate limiting mechanisms;

   *  Review and approval of submissions/messages;

   *  A private or public admonishment;

   *  Temporary or permanent bans in one or more fora.

   We stress that these are only examples, and not in any way
   prescriptive.  The moderator team is free to decide on these or other
   actions.

   The expectation is that the minimal action necessary to maintain the
   comity of a forum will be attempted.

   Any attempt to circumvent or otherwise ignore a moderation action is
   a demonstration of bad faith that may warrant further moderation.

   The moderator team is responsible to the IESG.  The IESG MAY create
   or designate a forum to facilitate discussion about moderation, and
   refer interested parties to that forum.  All actions taken by the
   moderator team SHALL be reported to the IESG, as well as to those
   against whom those actions are directed.  To address inappropriate
   contributions in a timely manner, only bans longer than fourteen (14)
   days SHALL be reported to the forum in which the person was banned,
   and in the case of a ban that spans more than one forum, to the
   community in a manner decided by the IESG.

   Content removal or redaction from IETF archives are not moderation
   actions, and are therefore beyond the scope of this memo.

4.1.  Appeals

   Because the moderator team serves at the discretion of the IESG, any
   moderation decision can be appealed to the IESG by anyone, per
   [RFC2026].  Disagreements with a decision by the moderator team can
   be brought to their attention.  If this does not lead to a
   resolution, a decision by the IESG can be appealed to the IAB as
   described in [RFC2026].

4.2.  Reinstatement

   People and circumstances change.  Individuals who have been banned
   from a forum may request reinstatement.  Any such request must be
   directed to the entity that made the decision (e.g., moderation team,
   working group chairs, etc.) or their successors, and that party may -
   at their discretion - reinstate someone, conditionally or
   unconditionally.  Decisions to not reinstate someone may not be
   appealed.  Requests for reinstatement may be entertained only a year
   after the initial decision, and then only annually.

   A ban imposed prior to this process shall be reconsidered only in
   accordance with the processes in place at the time of the ban, even
   if the corresponding RFC has been formally obsoleted.

5.  Relationship to other IETF functions

5.1.  Relation to the Ombudsteam

   The moderator team SHALL complement the efforts of the IETF
   ombudsteam [OT], whose focus on anti-harassment and operation SHALL
   remain unchanged.  The moderator team and ombudsteam are expected to
   work together in cases that may involve both disruptive behavior and
   harassment; they may determine the most effective way to do so in
   each case.  For example, the ombudsteam MAY decide to have one of
   their members serve as a liaison to the moderator team.

   The ombudsteam has strict rules of confidentiality.  If a moderation
   case overlaps with an ombudsteam case, confidential information MUST
   NOT be shared between the teams.

5.2.  Relation to the IETF LLC

   The Board of Directors of the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC) has
   fiduciary duty for the overall organization, which includes the duty
   to protect the organization from serious legal risk that may arise
   from the behavior of IETF participants.

   This protection MAY include the need for the IETF LLC to take
   emergency moderation actions.  These emergency actions are expected
   to be taken only when the IETF LLC has received legal advice that
   such action is necessary, and therefore extremely rare in frequency.
   Some examples of where this might be necessary are:

   *  Someone making credible threat of harm to other IETF participants.

   *  Someone using IETF mailing lists and/or websites to share content
      where publishing that content on IETF lists and/or websites brings
      serious legal risk.

   *  Someone making credible threats of legal action where any form of
      interaction with them on IETF mailing lists may have serious legal
      consequences for the IETF.

   If any such action is taken, the IETF LLC SHOULD, except where
   limited by legal advice to the contrary, inform the IESG as soon as
   possible, providing full details of the subject of the action, nature
   of the action, reason for the action and expected duration.  The IETF
   LLC SHOULD also inform the moderator team and IETF community, except
   where it receives legal advice to the contrary.

   As such an action would be taken by the IETF LLC in order to protect
   the IETF according to its fiduciary duty, then it cannot allow that
   to be overridden by a decision of the moderation team or the IESG.
   The subject of any such action may request a review by the IETF LLC
   board, as documented in section 4.7 of [RFC8711]

   Any such action taken by the IETF LLC under this section of this
   policy, is not subject to the rest of the policy in this document.

5.3.  Relation to the IRTF

   The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) [RFC2014] is a peer
   organization separate from the IETF that is governed by its own set
   or rules and processes.  Sections 3, 6 and 7 of
   [I-D.perkins-irtf-code-of-conduct] discuss rules for participating in
   the IRTF and moderation of IRTF participation channels.

6.  Security Considerations

   The usual security considerations [RFC3552] do not apply to this
   document.

   Potential abuse of the moderation process for the suppression of
   undesired opinions is counteracted by the availability of an appeals
   process, per Section 4.1.

   The actions of the moderator team are intended to limit the
   likelihood of disruptive behavior by a few IETF participants from
   discouraging participation by other IETF participants.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix B.  Problems with the Previous Approach

   The previous approach to moderation of disruptive participation
   through chairs, list administrators, and moderator teams, combined
   with the IESG-led process of PR-actions, has proven to be less than
   ideal:

   *  The IETF community has not been able to agree on a common
      definition of disruptive behavior.  Therefore, chairs and list
      administrators apply individually different criteria when making
      decisions, and participants have different expectations for when
      PR-actions are warranted.

   *  The moderation process that chairs and list administrators need to
      follow [RFC3934] is slow and cumbersome, which makes it ill-suited
      to situations that escalate quickly.  It also assumes that the
      originator of disruptive behavior is a misguided participant who
      can be reasoned with and who will change their ways.

   *  Chairs and list administrators may only enact moderation actions
      for their single list, which is ill-suited when a pattern of
      disruptive behavior spans multiple lists.  Also, chairs and list
      administrators may not be fully aware of disruptive behavior that
      spans multiple lists, due to not being subscribed to some of them.

   *  PR-actions, which can address disruptive behavior across several
      lists, are cumbersome and slow, and the community has not been
      able to agree on a common definition of disruptive behavior.  This
      has led to a situation where PR-actions are rarely used, and when
      they are used, they are perceived as very heavy-handed.

   *  For a given mailing list, participants may not feel comfortable
      reporting disruptive behavior to a chair or list administrator,
      for various reasons.  For mailing lists not associated with
      working groups, list administrators are not even publicly
      identified - they can only be contacted through an anonymous alias
      address.  This exacerbates the problem, because participants may
      not be comfortable reporting disruptive behavior to an anonymous
      party.

   *  The IETF offers participation not only through in-person meetings
      and mailing lists, which are the two channels of participation for
      which moderation processes are currently defined.  IETF business
      also happens in chat channels, remote meeting participation
      systems, virtual meetings, wikis, GitHub repositories, and more.
      How disruptive behavior is moderated in these channels is
      currently undefined.
