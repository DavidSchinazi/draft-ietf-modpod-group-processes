                     draft-ecahc-moderation-latest

Abstract

   This document describes the creation of a moderator team for all of
   the IETF's various contribution channels.  Without removing existing
   responsibilities for working group management, this team enables a
   uniform approach to moderation of disruptive participation across all
   mailing lists and other methods of IETF collaboration.

1.  Introduction

   This document proposes the creation of a moderator team for all of
   the IETF's various contribution channels.  This moderator team is
   modeled after, and subsumes, the moderator team for the IETF
   discussion list [RFC9245].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in their normal English sense; they
   are shown in uppercase for emphasis and clarity.

      |  TODO: Get feedback from the community whether this redefinition
      |  of BCP14 terms in process documents is something they support.

3.  Motivation

   The IETF community has defined general guidelines of conduct for
   personal interaction in the IETF [RFC7154], and the IESG has defined
   an anti-harassment policy for the IETF [AHP] for which the IETF
   community has defined anti-harassment procedures [RFC7776],
   empowering an ombudsteam [OT] to take necessary action.

   Dealing with _disruptive_ behavior, however, is not part of the role
   of the ombudsteam.  [RFC3934] task the chairs of each IETF working
   group with moderating their group's in-person meetings and mailing
   lists, and an IESG statement [MODML] describes additional guidance to
   working group chairs about how - but not when - to moderate their
   lists.

   For IETF mailing lists not associated with a working group, another
   IESG statement clarifies [DP] that the list administrators are tasked
   with moderation.  And the IETF list for general discussions has,
   mostly for historic reasons, a team of moderators that are not list
   administrators and operate by a different set of processes [RFC9245].

   In addition, [RFC3683] defines a process for revoking an individual's
   posting rights to IETF mailing lists following a community last-call
   of a "posting rights" action (PR-action) proposed by the IESG, often
   in response to complaints from the community.

   This fractured approach to moderation of disruptive participation
   through chairs, list administrators, and moderator teams, combined
   with the IESG-led process of PR-actions, has proven to be less than
   ideal:

   *  The IETF community has not been able to agree on a common
      definition of disruptive behavior.  Therefore, chairs and list
      administrators apply individually different criteria when making
      decisions, and participants have different expectations for when
      PR-actions are warranted.

   *  The moderation process that chairs and list administrators need to
      follow [RFC3934] is slow and cumbersome, which makes it ill-suited
      to situations that escalate quickly.  It also assumes that the
      originator of disruptive behavior is a misguided participant who
      can be reasoned with and who will change their ways.

   *  Chairs and list administrators may only enact moderation actions
      for their single list, which is ill-suited when a pattern of
      disruptive behavior spans multiple lists.  Also, chairs and list
      administrators may not be fully aware of disruptive behavior that
      spans multiple lists, due to not being subscribed to some of the
      affected.

   *  PR-actions, which can address disruptive behavior across several
      lists, are cumbersome and slow, and the community has not been
      able to agree on a common definition of disruptive behavior.  This
      has led to a situation where PR-actions are rarely used, and when
      they are used, they are perceived as very heavy-handed.

   *  For a given mailing list, participants may not feel comfortable
      reporting disruptive behavior to a chair or list administrator,
      for various reasons.  For mailing lists not associated with
      working groups, list administrators are not even publicly
      identified - they can only be contacted through an anonymous alias
      address.  This exacerbates the problem, because participants may
      not be comfortable reporting disruptive behavior to an anonymous
      party.

   *  The IETF offers participation not only through in-person meetings
      and mailing lists, which are the two channels of participation for
      which moderation processes are currently defined.  IETF business
      also happens in chat channels, remote meeting participation
      systems, virtual meetings, wikis, GitHub repositories, and more.
      How disruptive behavior is moderated in these channels is
      currently undefined.

4.  IETF Moderator Team

   This document proposes a different, uniform approach to moderating
   the IETF's various participation channels: a moderator team for the
   IETF.  The creation of this team intends to address the issues
   identified in Section 3.

      |  TODO: Decide whether moderation rights remain also with WG
      |  chairs, list admins, and others who currently have them, or
      |  whether all moderation rights centralize with the moderator
      |  team.

4.1.  Scope

   This IETF moderator team consists of a small number of individuals
   (no less than three) that SHALL moderate all the IETF's various
   current and future participation channels.  At present, these include
   mailing lists, chat channels, and discussions in other systems that
   the IETF or WGs have chosen to employ, such as GitHub repositories,
   Wikis, or issue trackers.

   It is not expected that the moderator team will be monitoring every
   IETF channel, but rather that participants will proactively flag
   concerns about disruptive behavior to the moderator team.  However,
   the moderator team SHOULD actively monitor a small set of key
   participation channels, including, for example, the IETF discussion
   and last-call mailing lists or the IETF plenary chat channel.  The
   moderator team should decide which channels are in this set based on
   their own judgment and community suggestions.

      |  TODO: Decide whether chairs and list admins should retain the
      |  ability to moderate their lists in addition to the moderator
      |  team, or whether chair and list admins should only inform the
      |  moderator team of potentially disruptive behavior and let them
      |  deal with it.

   It is important to note that the moderation team only moderates
   _public_ IETF participation channels.  Their mandate does not extend
   to problematic behavior in private channels, such as private chat
   channels, direct messages, or conversations or other interactions
   outside of meetings.  In such cases, the Ombudsteam should be
   approached.

   The management and moderation of participation channels associated
   with various IETF groups, inculding their mailing lists, chat
   channels and in-person, remote, or interim meetings remains primarily
   a task of the relevant group's management, such as WG chairs.
   However, moderators are available for consultation and assistance
   should issues arise, and they MAY proactively confer with the group
   management over potential patterns of behavior.  When moderators
   observe or are alerted to problematic behavior on such channels, they
   SHOULD consult with the group's management to jointly determine an
   appropriate moderation response.  The moderation team should respect
   the views of the group management in such cases, and the group
   management should respect the moderation team's task of upholding an
   overall IETF-wide uniformity for moderation.

   The moderator team MAY initiate moderation actions by itself;
   individual participants SHOULD also alert the team to disruptive
   behavior they observe.  Participants should be able to contact the
   moderator team in ways that are, ideally, integrated into the various
   participation channels the IETF offers.  The moderator team SHALL
   keep the identities of participants requesting moderation
   confidential.

4.2.  Transparency

   The moderator team SHALL operate according to a consistent set of
   criteria, processes, and actions.  The moderator team SHALL
   independently define and execute their role.  They SHALL maintain a
   public set of moderation criteria, processes, actions, and other
   material that allows the community to understand and comment on the
   role of the team.  The moderator team SHOULD consider adopting
   moderation criteria, processes, and actions that other technical
   communities have found suitable.  The moderator team's criteria and
   processes SHALL be developed with community input, but they are not
   expected to be documented in the RFC series.

   Some of these processes may rely on automated mechanisms, such as
   rate-limiting emails to lists or messages to chat channels.  (The
   IETF's deliberately low bar to participation makes it easy to create
   throw-away personas for such denial-of-service behavior.)

      |  TODO: This gives the moderator team broad freedom to define
      |  processes and actions.  Should this document define some
      |  boundaries for what the moderator team can do?

   The moderator team SHOULD create and maintain a public mailing list
   for the community to discuss both the general moderation criteria and
   individual moderation decisions.  To not distract from the topic-
   oriented discussion on other IETF lists, such meta-discussions SHOULD
   be actively redirected to the moderation discussion list.

4.3.  Membership

   The IETF Chair appoints and replaces members of the moderator team.
   Apart from appointing and replacing moderators, the IETF Chair SHALL
   refrain from the day-to-day operation and management of the moderator
   team.  The moderator team MAY decide to consult with the IETF Chair
   when needed.

   Because the IESG and IAB are in the appeals chain for moderator team
   decisions (see Section 4.5), the IETF Chair MUST NOT appoint a
   moderator who is serving on the IESG or IAB.  Individuals serving on
   other bodies to which the NomCom appoints members, such as the IETF
   Trust or the LLC Board, as well as LLC staff and contractors SHALL
   also be excluded from serving on the moderator team.  If a moderator
   is assuming any such role, they SHALL step down from the moderator
   team soon after.

4.4.  Training

   The IETF is committed to providing and/or funding training for
   appointed moderators as necessary.  The IETF Chair will negotiate any
   required funding or resources with IETF Administration LLC [RFC8711].

4.5.  Appeals

   Because the moderator team serves at the discretion of the IETF
   Chair, any moderation decision can be appealed to the IETF Chair by
   anyone, per [RFC2026].  Disagreements with a decision by the IETF
   Chair can brought to their attention.  If this does not lead to a
   resolution, a decision by the IETF Chair can be appealed as described
   in [RFC2026], as with any other Area Director decision.  In this
   case, the appeals chain starts with an appeal to the entire IESG.

4.6.  Team Diversity

   Due to the global nature of the IETF, the membership of this team
   SHOULD reflect a diversity of time zones and other participant
   characteristics that lets it operate effectively around the clock and
   throughout the year.  Ideally, the moderator team should be able to
   respond to issues within a few hours.

   Team diversity is also important to ensure any participant observing
   problematic behavior can identify a moderator they feel comfortable
   contacting.

4.7.  Relation to Ombudsteam

   The moderator team SHALL complement the efforts of the IETF
   ombudsteam [OT], whose focus on anti-harassment and operation SHALL
   remain unchanged.  The moderator team and ombudsteam are expected to
   work together in cases that may involve both disruptive behavior and
   harassment; they may determine the most effective way to do so in
   each case.  For example, the ombudsteam MAY decide to have one of
   their members serve as a liaison to the moderator team.

   The ombudsteam has strict rules of confidentiality.  If a moderation
   case overlaps with an ombudsteam case, confidential information MUST
   NOT be shared between the teams.

5.  Changes to Existing RFCs

   Creation of the IETF moderator team requires some changes to existing
   RFCs and also requires the IESG to update a number of their
   statements.  This section describes these changes.

      |  TODO: Add once we know this I-D will go forward in some form.

6.  Security Considerations

   The usual security considerations [RFC3552] do not apply to this
   document.

   Potential abuse of the moderation process for the suppression of
   undesired opinions is counteracted by the availability of an appeals
   process, per Section 4.5.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
